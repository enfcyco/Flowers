## 🎯 Summary
Create a dedicated image gallery page that showcases all flower photos in a grid layout with filtering capabilities by date and category.

## 📋 Problem
Currently, all images are embedded within blog articles on the homepage. There's no easy way to:
- Browse all flower photos at once
- Filter photos by season or type
- See a visual overview of the farm's growing journey

## 💡 Proposed Solution

### Create `gallery.html` page with:

#### 1. Grid Layout
- Responsive grid (4 columns desktop, 2 columns tablet, 1 column mobile)
- Thumbnail images that expand to full size on click (using existing modal functionality)
- Display image date and caption on hover

#### 2. Filter Controls
- Filter by year: 2025, 2026, All
- Filter by season: Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter, All
- Filter by category: Pumpkins & Gourds, Flowers, Seeds, Wildlife, All
- Clear filters button

#### 3. Navigation
- Add "Gallery" link to main navigation menu
- Breadcrumb navigation showing Home > Gallery

#### 4. Performance
- Use lazy loading for images below the fold
- Only load images when they enter viewport
- Maintain optimized image sizes (already done)

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Files to Create/Modify:
- `gallery.html` - New gallery page
- `gallery.js` - JavaScript for filtering logic
- `styles.css` - Add gallery-specific styles
- `index.html`, `about.html`, `shop.html` - Add Gallery link to nav

### CSS Classes Needed:
```css
.gallery-container { /* Grid container */ }
.gallery-item { /* Individual photo tile */ }
.filter-bar { /* Filter controls */ }
.filter-button { /* Category/date buttons */ }
.active-filter { /* Selected filter state */ }
```

### JavaScript Functionality:
```javascript
// Filter images by data attributes
// data-year="2025"
// data-season="fall"
// data-category="pumpkins"
```
