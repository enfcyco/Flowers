## Adding Images to Blog Entries

Images are organized by date in the `images/` directory:

1. Create a new directory in `images/` with the date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format
2. Add your image files to that directory
3. Reference them in your HTML: `<img src="images/YYYY-MM-DD/filename.jpeg" alt="Description">`

See `images/README.md` for more details.
