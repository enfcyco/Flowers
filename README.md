## Adding Images to Blog Entries

### 🚀 Automated Method (Easiest)

1. Drop your raw images in the **root directory**
2. Say to Copilot: **"Optimize new images"**
3. Or manually trigger: [Actions > Optimize Images](https://github.com/enfcyco/Flowers/actions/workflows/optimize-images.yml)

The workflow will automatically:
- Generate web, Instagram, and Facebook versions
- Move them to `images/YYYY-MM-DD/`
- Remove originals
- Show optimization stats

See [QUICK-START-IMAGE-OPTIMIZATION.md](QUICK-START-IMAGE-OPTIMIZATION.md) for details.

### Manual Method

Images are organized by date in the `images/` directory:

1. Create a new directory in `images/` with the date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format
2. **OPTIMIZE images before adding** (see Performance section below)
3. Add optimized image files to that directory
4. Reference them in your HTML: `<img src="images/YYYY-MM-DD/filename.jpeg" alt="Description">`

See `images/README.md` for detailed optimization instructions.

## Performance Best Practices

This site is optimized for fast loading on both desktop and mobile devices, including slow 3G connections.

### Image Optimization (REQUIRED)

All images must be optimized before adding to the repository:
- **Max width**: 1920px (web displays don't benefit from larger)
- **JPEG quality**: 85% (imperceptible quality loss)
- **Expected size**: 400-800KB per image (down from 3-8MB raw photos)

**Why this matters:**
- Unoptimized 8.5MB image: 3 minutes on 3G
- Optimized 1MB image: 5 seconds on 3G
- 95% improvement in load time!

**Quick optimization command:**
```bash
convert image.jpeg -resize "1920x>" -quality 85 optimized.jpeg
jpegoptim --max=85 --strip-all optimized.jpeg
```

See `images/README.md` for complete optimization guide including online tools.

### Performance Benchmarks

- **Total page size**: 4.9MB (down from 26MB)
- **3G load time**: ~15 seconds (down from 5 minutes)
- **Optimization**: 81% file size reduction with no visible quality loss
